    <h3>PRSCO</h3>
    <p>
      The Pacific Regional Science Conference Organisation (PRSCO) was founded
      during the 7th Annual Meeting of the Western Regional Science Association
      (WRSA) held in San Diego from February 1–4, 1968. This initiative was
      spearheaded by representatives from the WRSA and the Japan Section of the
      Regional Science Association (JSRSA). The inaugural PRSCO conference took
      place at the East-West Center, University of Hawaii, from August 26–29,
      1969. Since then, both major conferences and smaller meetings have been
      hosted in various countries across the Pacific Rim. A full international
      conference is organized every two years, with a smaller summer institute
      held in alternate years.
      <br /><br />As one of the four supra-regional associations of the Regional
      Science Association International (RSAI), established in 1954, the PRSCO
      promotes and facilitates the exchange of research and knowledge in
      regional science. This includes fostering collaboration among members of
      PRSCO's affiliated sections and other individuals interested in regional
      science within the Pacific Rim. <br /><br />The PRSCO operates as a
      federation, uniting various affiliated sections and associations of the
      Regional Science Association International across the Pacific Rim region
