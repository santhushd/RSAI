    <h4>RSAI</h4>
    <p>
      The Regional Science Association International (RSAI) consists of four
      supra-regional organizations that bring together national and
      international sections or associations: The European Regional Science
      Association (ERSA), the North American Regional Science Council (NARSC),
      the Pacific Regional Science Conference Organisation (PRSCO), and the
      Latin America Regional Science Association (LARSA). RSAI represents a
      global network with a membership exceeding 4,000 individuals. <br /><br />
      Established in 1954, RSAI was created to foster the open exchange of ideas
      and perspectives in the field of regional science. <br /><br />
      RSAIâ€™s members come from diverse academic disciplines and professional
      backgrounds, united by a shared interest in spatial and regional issues
      from across the globe.
